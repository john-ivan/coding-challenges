Time and Space Complexity - O(N)

1. cors /no cors etc (setting headers)
2. using fetch API do to the same as jquery
3. Use vanilla JS to do the fetch
4. innertext vs textContent
5. image links still break sometimes, find out why.
6. understanding promises under the hood
7. understand RegExp obj, note \b and ig (regex)
8. Possibly memoize for speed
9. Can selectively target body content more accurately

10. Account for multiple words sharing the same count as the word in the 25th position. (26 onwards);
11. textContent is faster than innerText > refactor
12. change banned words to an object
